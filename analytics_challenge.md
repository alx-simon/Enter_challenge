# Business Intelligence Data Challenge
## Introduction

Welcome to the Enter Business Intelligence Data Challenge! The aim of this challenge is to evaluate your capacity to grapple with real-world data scenarios. We've curated a dataset that replicates some of the data-related obstacles you might face as a member of Enter's Analytics Team. The dataset comprises two tables: orders and appointments.

## Guidelines

This challenge invites you to apply your analytical prowess and business acumen to uncover insights hidden within our dataset. Here are some suggested steps to help you structure your approach:

- **Data Integration:** The provided datasets are related. Your first challenge is to identify these connections and appropriately merge the datasets into a unified view.

- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: Dive into the joined dataset. Apply your data analytic skills and business knowledge to clean, process and explore the data, making it ready for analysis. Address issues like missing data, duplicates, data types, and inconsistencies as needed. The data quality is not optimal, here it is more important to make reasonable assumptions and decisions and document them.

- **Data Visualization and Interpretation**: It is vital to present your insights in a clear and impactful way. Design your visualizations keeping stakeholders in mind - clarity, simplicity, and relevance are key.

## Questions of Interest

While you are free to explore the data and uncover insights as you see fit, here are some guiding questions that might direct your investigation:

- **Order Processing Analysis**: Investigate how orders are currently being processed, so the times it takes between different appointments. Are there any noticeable bottlenecks? Can you identify any trends or patterns that change over time?

- **Additional Insights**: Beyond the provided guidelines, we encourage you to dive deeper and bring to light any additional insights you think could be beneficial to the business.

This challenge is designed to allow you to showcase not only your technical skills, but also your creativity, business sense, and ability to derive actionable insights from data. Good luck!
